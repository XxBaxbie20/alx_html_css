# HTML & CSS Advanced Project

This project is a continuation of the **HTML Advanced** task.  
It focuses on implementing **modern, responsive CSS styling** to a semantic HTML structure designed from a Figma layout.

---

## 🧱 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform a pure HTML structure into a visually appealing, fully styled webpage that accurately matches the provided Figma design.

The HTML file defines the correct semantic structure (`header`, `main`, `sections`, `footer`).  
This stage applies **advanced CSS techniques** for layout, typography, spacing, and responsiveness.
